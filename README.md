# gut-brain axis

This project aims to create a computational model to represent the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA) using the agent-based framework Repast4Py. This implementation seeks to simulate the complex interplay between the gut and brain systems, emphasizing their bidirectional communication and the role of various physiological processes and molecules exchanged within the GBA channels. By leveraging the Repast4Py framework, the project tries to develop a sophisticated simulation environment where agents representing different components of the gut and brain systems interact and influence each other's states and behaviors. Through this computational model, we aim to gain insights into the the relationship between the GBA and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly neuroinflammation.

This project outlines the concept of the "Gut-Brain Axis" (GBA), which describes the interconnection between the gut and brain, mediated by various channels facilitating bidirectional communication. Key systems involved include the immune system, the enteric nervous system (ENS)â€“central nervous system (CNS) axis, the cardiovascular system, and the neuroendocrine system, which play pivotal roles in transmitting chemical messages. Molecules exchanged within the GBA channels mainly include metabolites, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Additionally, the microbiota, comprising bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea, residing in environments like the human gut, is a crucial component of the GBA.
